--SQLite query for com.apple.routined - Cache.Sqlite ZRTCLLOCATIONMO Table
--Database can be located at /private/var/mobile/Library/Caches/com.apple.routined/Cache.sqlite
--This query has both UTC and Local Date and Time
--This query has been made so that it only pulls locations with a ZHORIZONTALACCURACY < 65 meters
--This query has been made so that it only pulls locations between certain dates
--This query has original data and calculated Accuracy and Speeds
--This query was tested and works with iOS versions 13.5.1, 14.0.1, 14.4.2, 14.6, and 14.7.1 
--For details see blog post here: PENDING
